## What is LinkSprout?

LinkSprout is a free, open-source alternative to services like Linktree, Beacons, and Carrd. It runs entirely in your browser, giving you complete control and privacy. Create your page with a live visual editor, download the files, and host it anywhere you want—for free, forever.

## Key Features

-   **✅ 100% Free & Open Source:** No hidden costs, "pro" features, or subscriptions. Everything is available from the start.
-   **🚫 No Login Required:** Works entirely in your browser. Your data is yours; it's never stored on our servers.
-   **🎨 Live Visual Editor:** See your changes in real-time as you customize fonts, colors, backgrounds, and layouts.
-   **✨ Rich Customization:**
    -   Choose from dozens of Google Fonts or upload your own.
    -   Advanced background options: gradients, images, and beautiful procedural generators (waves, blobs, low-poly).
    -   Customize button shapes, shadows, and hover animations.
-   **🧩 Diverse Elements:** Add buttons, social media icons, text blocks, QR codes, call-to-actions, and even embed custom HTML (like a YouTube video or a contact form).
-   **🚀 Deploy Anywhere:** Get a single, optimized `index.html` file or a complete `.zip` package. Host your site for free on services like **[GitHub Pages](deploy.md)**, Netlify, or Vercel, or on your own server.
-   **📱 PWA Ready:** Make your page an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) on mobile devices with a custom-generated or uploaded icon.
-   **💧 No Watermark:** The "Built with LinkSprout" footer is completely optional and can be disabled or customized.

## How It Works

1.  **Open the Editor:** Go to [linksprout.github.io](https://linksprout.github.io).
2.  **Customize:** Use the intuitive controls to design your page. Add your links, style your profile, and choose your theme.
3.  **Download:** Click the "Download" button to get your site as a single HTML file or a complete ZIP package.
4.  **Deploy:** Upload the downloaded file(s) to your hosting provider. See our simple guide for **[deploying to GitHub Pages](deploy.md)**.
